# Validate Documentation Against Source

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- User updates content in documentation files about GitHub Copilot
- User edits files describing Copilot primitives (instructions, prompts, agents, skills, MCP)
- User explicitly asks to verify facts or check accuracy
- User mentions "validate", "verify", "check source", or "fact-check"
- Content references file paths, settings, or configuration options
- **Before any commit** that includes changes to documentation files
- User is preparing a PR with documentation changes

## Pre-Commit Validation (Required)

**This skill MUST run before committing documentation changes.**

When the user attempts to commit changes to files in `docs/` or any `*.md` files that document Copilot features:

1. Automatically identify all claims that reference official features
2. Validate against primary sources
3. **If discrepancies are found:** Prompt the user before proceeding

### Pre-Commit Workflow

```
User: "commit these changes" / "git commit" / prepares commit

Agent:
1. Detect documentation files in staged changes
2. Run validation on changed content
3. If all clear → Proceed with commit
4. If issues found → Prompt user (see below)
```

## Primary Sources

Always validate against these authoritative sources:

| Topic | Primary Source |
|-------|----------------|
| VS Code Copilot features | https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot |
| Custom instructions | https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/custom-instructions |
| Prompt files | https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/prompt-files |
| Custom agents | https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/custom-agents |
| Agent skills | https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/agent-skills |
| MCP servers | https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/mcp-servers |
| GitHub Copilot docs | https://docs.github.com/en/copilot |
| Repository instructions | https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/customizing-copilot/adding-repository-custom-instructions-for-github-copilot |
| Agent Skills spec | https://agentskills.io/specification |
| Source code (VS Code) | https://github.com/microsoft/vscode |
| Source code (Copilot Chat) | https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-copilot-chat |

## Version Tracking (Required)

**Always identify and report the version context for all validated content.**

### Determining Current GA Versions

Before validating, fetch current GA (Generally Available) versions:

| Product | Version Source | How to Check |
|---------|---------------|--------------|
| VS Code | https://code.visualstudio.com/updates | Look for "Version X.YZ" at top |
| Copilot Chat Extension | VS Code Marketplace or release tags | Check `microsoft/vscode-copilot-chat` releases |
| GitHub Copilot (web) | https://github.blog/changelog | Search for Copilot announcements |

### Version Status Categories

Mark each documented feature with its version status:

| Status | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| 🟢 **GA** | Feature is in current stable release | Document normally |
| 🟡 **Preview** | Feature is in VS Code Insiders or preview | Add clear "Preview" label |
| 🔵 **Future** | Feature announced but not yet released | Add prominent warning |
| 🔴 **Deprecated** | Feature has been removed or replaced | Update or remove content |

### Version Callout Format

**Always include version context in validation reports:**

```markdown
## Version Context

**Validated against:**
- VS Code: {version} (GA/Insiders)
- Copilot Chat Extension: v{version}
- Documentation date: {date on docs page}

**Content references:**
- GA features: {count}
- Preview features: {count} ⚠️
- Future features: {count} ⚠️
```

### Future Version Warnings

**When content references features not yet in GA, add a prominent warning:**

```markdown
⚠️ **FUTURE VERSION REFERENCE DETECTED**

The following content references features not yet generally available:

| Feature | Current Status | Expected GA |
|---------|---------------|-------------|
| {feature} | Insiders only | {if known} |
| {feature} | Announced | {if known} |

**This documentation describes upcoming functionality.**
Readers using the stable VS Code release may not have access to these features.

**Options:**
1. **Add version badge** - Mark section with "Available in VS Code Insiders" or "Coming soon"
2. **Move to future section** - Separate from GA content
3. **Remove for now** - Document only when GA
4. **Keep as-is** - Proceed with clear labeling (requires explicit confirmation)
```

### Version Mismatch Prompt

When documented version doesn't match GA:

```
⚠️ **Version Mismatch Detected**

Your documentation appears to reference **VS Code {doc_version}** features,
but the current GA release is **VS Code {ga_version}**.

| Feature | Documented As | Actually Available In |
|---------|--------------|----------------------|
| {feature} | GA | Insiders {version}+ |
| {setting} | Default: {value} | Default changed in {version} |

**How would you like to proceed?**

1. **Update to GA** - Adjust content to match current stable release
2. **Add version note** - Keep content but add "Requires VS Code {version}+"
3. **Split content** - Separate GA features from preview/future features
4. **Confirm as-is** - Document is intentionally forward-looking
```

### Checking Version Information

When validating, always check:

1. **VS Code release notes** - https://code.visualstudio.com/updates
   - Features are listed by version with "New in {version}" markers
   
2. **Copilot Chat changelog** - Check GitHub releases
   - Extension version determines available features
   
3. **Documentation page dates** - Most VS Code docs show last updated date
   - Bottom of page or in page metadata
   
4. **GitHub docs versioning** - Some pages have version selectors
   - Ensure you're viewing the current version, not fptc (future)

### Version in Commit Messages

When committing documentation that references specific versions:

```
docs: update always-on instructions for VS Code 1.109

- Verified against VS Code 1.109 GA release
- Added /init command (new in 1.108)
- Updated setting names per 1.107 changes
```

## Validation Workflow

### Step 0: Determine Current GA Versions (Always First)

Before any content validation:

1. Fetch https://code.visualstudio.com/updates to get current VS Code GA version
2. Check Copilot Chat extension version from marketplace or releases
3. Note the documentation page's last-updated date
4. Record these in the validation report header

### Step 1: Identify Claims to Validate

Scan the content for:
- **File paths** (e.g., `.github/copilot-instructions.md`)
- **Setting names** (e.g., `github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.useInstructionFiles`)
- **Feature descriptions** (e.g., "instructions are applied to inline suggestions")
- **Frontmatter fields** (e.g., `applyTo`, `description`)
- **Behavioral claims** (e.g., "Copilot prioritizes personal instructions over repository instructions")

### Step 2: Fetch Current Documentation

Use web fetch tools to retrieve the current official documentation:

1. Fetch the relevant VS Code docs page for the topic
2. Fetch the relevant GitHub docs page if applicable
3. Search source repositories for implementation details if needed

### Step 3: Compare and Flag Discrepancies

For each claim, determine:
- ✅ **Confirmed** - Claim matches official documentation for current GA version
- ⚠️ **Outdated** - Information was accurate but has changed
- ❌ **Incorrect** - Claim contradicts official documentation
- ❓ **Unverifiable** - Cannot find authoritative source
- 🔵 **Future** - Feature exists but only in preview/Insiders (not GA)

### Step 4: Report Findings

Provide a summary:

```markdown
## Validation Report

**File:** {filename}
**Date:** {current date}

### Version Context
| Product | GA Version | Doc References |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| VS Code | {version} | {version if mentioned} |
| Copilot Chat | v{version} | {version if mentioned} |

**Version Status:** 🟢 All GA / 🟡 Contains Preview / 🔵 Contains Future

### Findings

| Claim | Status | Version | Notes |
|-------|--------|---------|-------|
| {claim 1} | ✅/⚠️/❌/❓/🔵 | GA/Preview/Future | {explanation} |
| {claim 2} | ✅/⚠️/❌/❓/🔵 | GA/Preview/Future | {explanation} |

### Version Warnings

{If any 🔵 Future items exist:}
⚠️ This documentation references {N} features not yet in GA release.
See "Future Version Warnings" section for details.

### Recommended Updates

1. {Update 1}
2. {Update 2}
```

## User Prompts for Challenges

**When validation finds issues (⚠️, ❌, or ❓), you MUST prompt the user before proceeding.**

### Prompt Templates

#### When Discrepancies Found (Pre-Commit)

```
⚠️ **Validation found {N} issue(s) in your documentation changes:**

| Issue | Claim | Problem |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 1 | "{claim}" | {what's wrong} |
| 2 | "{claim}" | {what's wrong} |

**How would you like to proceed?**

1. **Fix now** - Update the content to match official documentation
2. **Commit anyway** - Proceed with current content (not recommended)
3. **Review details** - Show full validation report with sources
4. **Cancel** - Abort the commit to investigate further
```

#### When Source Cannot Be Verified

```
❓ **Unable to verify {N} claim(s) against official sources:**

- "{claim 1}" - No authoritative source found
- "{claim 2}" - Documentation page unavailable

**Options:**

1. **Add citation** - Mark these claims with [needs verification]
2. **Remove claims** - Delete unverifiable statements
3. **Proceed anyway** - Commit with unverified content
4. **Research more** - I'll search additional sources
```

#### When Content is Outdated

```
⚠️ **{N} item(s) may be outdated:**

| Item | Current Doc Says | Your Content Says |
|------|------------------|-------------------|
| {setting/path} | {official value} | {your value} |

**This likely changed in a recent VS Code/Copilot update.**

1. **Update to current** - Apply the official values
2. **Keep as-is** - Your content may be intentionally different
3. **Show diff** - Compare full context from both sources
```

### Decision Recording

After user responds, record the decision:

```markdown
<!-- Validation: {date} -->
<!-- Decision: {user choice} -->
<!-- Reviewer: {user/auto} -->
```

This creates an audit trail for future reference.

## Blocking Commits

If critical issues are found (❌ status), **strongly recommend** blocking the commit:

```
🛑 **Critical accuracy issue detected**

The claim "{claim}" directly contradicts official documentation:
- **Your content:** {what you wrote}
- **Official docs:** {what docs say}
- **Source:** {url}

This could mislead readers. I recommend fixing before committing.

**Proceed anyway?** (type "yes" to override)
```

Only proceed if user explicitly confirms.

## What to Validate

### Always Check

- File paths for configuration files
- VS Code setting names and their default values
- Frontmatter field names and allowed values
- Feature availability (which features apply to which contexts)
- Priority/precedence rules
- Required vs optional configurations

### Common Pitfalls

| Claim Type | Common Issue |
|------------|--------------|
| File paths | Locations may change between versions |
| Settings | Settings may be deprecated or renamed |
| Feature scope | Features may apply to Chat only, not inline suggestions |
| Syntax | Frontmatter fields or glob patterns may have specific rules |
| Defaults | Default values for settings change |

## Example: Validating Always-On Instructions

**Content being validated:**
> Custom instructions are applied to all Copilot interactions including inline suggestions.

**Validation steps:**
1. Fetch https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/custom-instructions
2. Search for "inline suggestions" or "ghost text"
3. Find: "Custom instructions are not taken into account for inline suggestions as you type"

**Result:** ❌ Incorrect

**Recommended fix:** Update to state that custom instructions only affect Copilot Chat, not inline suggestions.

## Handling Unverifiable Claims

If a claim cannot be verified:
1. Check if it's an opinion or recommendation (doesn't need verification)
2. Search source repositories for implementation
3. Flag for manual review with note about what was checked
4. Consider adding "[needs citation]" or removing the claim

## Integration with Updates

When content is updated:
1. **Before committing:** Run validation on changed sections
2. **After fetching sources:** Compare key facts
3. **On discrepancy:** Either update content or flag for human review
4. **Always:** Add or update citation links (format: `[*](https://...)`) for verifiable claims

## Quick Reference: Key Settings

These settings are frequently referenced and should be validated:

| Setting | Purpose | Default |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.useInstructionFiles` | Enable `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | Check docs |
| `chat.instructionsFilesLocations` | Folders for `.instructions.md` files | `.github/instructions` |
| `chat.useAgentsMdFile` | Enable `AGENTS.md` support | Check docs |
| `chat.useAgentSkills` | Enable skills loading | Check docs |
| `chat.includeApplyingInstructions` | Auto-apply instructions with `applyTo` | Check docs |

**Note:** Always fetch current documentation to verify default values, as they may change.
